# Knnbot: a KNN Messenger Bot

Knnbot is a Facebook Messenger bot written in Python, capable of training a machine learning algorithm known as [K-Nearest Neighbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) using manually inputted data from a user. This project is more on the experimental side, a simple proof of concept where I wanted to show a use case of how a machine learning algorithm could be applied to a chatbot.
